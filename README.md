The aim of this repository is to provide simple tools to help those working with ColabFold BATCH both for pre and post-processing steps.

## Notebooks
- Pre-Processing: *coming soon*
- Post-Processing: [ColabFold BATCH Score Extractor](https://colab.research.google.com/github/andyposbe/ColabFold-Pipeline-Toolkit/blob/main/Score_Extractor.ipynb)

## Description

This repository is dedicated to providing resources and tools to enhance the efficiency of working with ColabFold BATCH pipelines. Here, you will find a collection of Google Colab notebooks that are designed to simplify and automate the pre-processing and post-processing steps in protein structure prediction using ColabFold and ColabFold BATCH.

## Features

- **Pre-Processing Notebooks**: Scripts to prepare your data for processing with ColabFold. This includes the preparation of input fasta files that meet the standard requirements for 2-way AlphaFold-Multimer screens.
- **Post-Processing Notebooks**: Tools to analyze and visualize the results from ColabFold screens.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on how to use these notebooks effectively.
- **FAQs**: Answers to common questions and troubleshooting tips.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a Google account and access to Google Colab.
2. **Installation**: No installation needed, just copy the desired notebooks.

## How to Use

- **Accessing Notebooks**: Direct links to the Google Colab notebooks are provided. Simply click on a link to open a notebook in Google Colab.
- **Running Notebooks**: Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the pre-processing or post-processing steps.
